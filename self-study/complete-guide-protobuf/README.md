# Complete Guide to Protocol Buffers 3 [Java, Golang, Python]

This sub-repo has been built for self study purpose with a Udemy course for [Protocol Buffers 3](https://www.udemy.com/protocol-buffers/learn/v4/overview)

## About this course

Google Protobuf with examples and exercises. Code in Java Go Python. Say Goodbye to JSON & XML. Pre-req to gRPC

## Description

**Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** is a fundamental data serialization format that every Data Engineer should know about. It is leveraged by many top tech companies such as Google and enables micro-services to transfer data in a format that is safe and efficient. **Stop using XML and JSON and start using a Data Format that will allow you to create the most efficient APIs.**
