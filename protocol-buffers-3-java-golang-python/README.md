# Complete Guide to Protocol Buffers 3 [Java, Golang, Python]

This sub-repo has been built for self study purpose with a Udemy course for [Protocol Buffers 3](https://www.udemy.com/protocol-buffers/learn/v4/overview)

## About this course

Google Protobuf with examples and exercises. Code in Java Go Python. Say Goodbye to JSON & XML. Pre-req to gRPC

## Description

**Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** is a fundamental data serialization format that every Data Engineer should know about. It is leveraged by many top tech companies such as Google and enables micro-services to transfer data in a format that is safe and efficient.

**In this course, we are going to explore in depth, with hands-on lectures, all the aspects of Protocol Buffers 3.**

In just a few hours, you will know everything you need to know to create simple and complex .proto files, and write code in your Favourite Programming language such as Java, Python and Go. Protocol Buffers generates all the boilerplate code for you!

**Stop using XML and JSON and start using a Data Format that will allow you to create the most efficient APIs.**
