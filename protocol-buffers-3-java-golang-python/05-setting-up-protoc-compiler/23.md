# Section 5. Setting up Protoc Compiler

## 23. Practice Using `protoc`

### Practice Using `protoc`

This was a short video, and the best way to get a feel for `protoc` is to practice!

So go ahead! As an exercise, use `protoc` to create javascript code (`--js_out`  option) on the files we have created in the code folder. 

Happy learning :)

### Actual Trial

We have pre-written files with this structure

`/proto/complex.proto`  
`/proto/enum_example.proto`  
`/proto/simple.proto`  

and run this command:

```bash
protoc -I=proto --js_out=outputs/javascript proto/*.proto
```

therefore, we can get `*.javascript` file from these `*.proto` file under the directory `outputs/javascript`. If you want to get another codes for different languages, for example, python and java, you can also do this:

```bash
protoc -I=proto --java_out=outputs/java proto/*.proto
protoc -I=proto --python_out=outputs/python proto/*.proto
```
